Hello everyone !
----

I am a student at Openclassrooms. As part of my studies I have created this professional blog with PHP.
In this blog, you can create an account, post comments, publish articles if you are admin, ...


To install my projet in your local server, there are mandatory pre-requisites:
You must have the version 7.4 of PHP or newest, phpMyAdmin, MySQL and have downloaded Composer.

If you have these pre-requisites, follow the following steps :

1) Clone or download this repository, create a new folder "blogphp" in your server and place the projet in it.

2) Run `composer install` in command in the folder "blogphp".

3) Create a new database : run the file database.sql in phpMyAdmin.

4) In the folder "config", copy configSample.json and name it config.json. In it, change the data to correspond with your database.

5) In the same folder, copy emailConfigSample.json and name it emailConfig.json. In it, change the data to correspond to your email adress, password and smtp service.


I hope you will like my blog !

Have a nice day,
